# Backgammon 

Backgammon is a game for two players, played on a board consisting of twenty-four narrow triangles called points. The objective of the game is to move all your checkers into your own home board and then bear them off. The first player to bear off all of their checkers wins the game. This was part of my Software Engineering coursework assessment and was done with my partner.
